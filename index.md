### About me
Now I'm studying in the Minsk Radioengineering College in my last year. There I began to develop as a programmer. Some years I studied c# and sql. A few months ago I started learning web programming. I'm not going to stop there and want to continue to improve my skills. My main target is to become a developer in a successful IT company.

### Interests
- _Reading._ I like to spend time with an interesting book.
- _Travelling._ I like to watch and study the culture and traditions of other peoples. I am also attracted to modern architecture.
- _Biking._ I like to leave outside the city limits, especially by Bicycle.
