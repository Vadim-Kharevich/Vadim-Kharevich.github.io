				<h2>About me</h2>
				Now I'm studying in the Minsk Radioengineering College on the last course. There I began to develop as a programmer. Some years I studied c# and sql. A few months ago I started learning web programming. I'm not going to stop there and want to continue to improve my skills. My main target is to become a developer in a successful IT company.
